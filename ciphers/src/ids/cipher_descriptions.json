That number corresponds to some letter in the alphabet.

The user chooses a message key consisting of a number from 2 to 6 (keeping 7 for emergencies) that identifies a column on the left and then letter to identify a row in that column. The message, which consists only of digits, is then encrypted using the right portion of the row. For instance the number '1' can be encoded as either of the numbers in its column that are on the selected row. Because '0' is expected to be common it has four options. The digits are not numbers but form code-groups from a set of vocabulary cards [COMING SOON]. A switch to numeric digits can be indicates by a code-group. The 'CH' symbol indicates the end of a numeric section.\nAs a tactical cipher BATCO relies mainly on frequent key changes to stay secure. A different message key should be used every time and the code pages should be changed regularly. Messages are also limited to 22 characters, giving very little text for an attacker to analyze. Furthermore so long as the vocabulary cards remain secret they make decryption nearly impossible even if an attacker is able to decrypt a message. The greatest security feature of BATCO, like any tactical cipher, is that messages should be useful for only a few hours which is often insufficient to bring them to the attention of cryptanalysis.",

The practical security of the cipher probably relied on low literacy in the era and lack of knowledge of the method of encryption. Since there are only as many possible keys as letters in the alphabet it is trivial to check all of them even if working by hand. In modern terms Caesar ciphers generally have a keyspace of less than six bits. Increasing the keyspace does not provide additional security for a Caesar cipher, however, as it can be attacked the same way as any simple substitution cipher.",

In 1999 the Electronic Frontier Foundation produced Depp Crack to highlight this weakness, the machine cost about $250,000 and could crack an DES encrypted message in about 56 hours.

A stencil and a square of letters defined the key for a day. Every row and column of the stencil was assigned a two letter code which could be encrypted using the square. Columns were also assigned numbers. Before encryption the message needed to be padded to at least 60 characters. The operator then picked a random open cell in the stencil, its row and column were encrypted as part of the message key. After writing the message into the stencil, wrapping around to the beginning as needed, the operator then selected a random column. The code for that column was also encrypted and formed the rest of the key. The operator then read off the columns in numerical order, starting with the number of the column selected and wrapping around after reaching the highest number. Finally the message key, the length of the message, and encrypted message itself were transmitted.",

The core of the algorithm relies on it being easy to multiply prime numbers together but much more difficult to factor their product. For very large prime numbers (thousands of bits in length) there is in fact no known feasible way to factor them even with the aid of supercomputers and advanced mathematics. The version of RSA presented here is a naive implementation that is vulnerable to chosen-plaintext attacks as it does not have padding or a nonce. It is also possible to select prime numbers p and q that product a number which is easy to factor by certain techniques (while this would not be obvious by looking at the public key it would be tested by an competent attacker) so secure versions of RSA must not allow arbitrary primes to be used.",

Encryption and decryption first involves a lengthy key derivation process to ensure that small key changes will result in very different results. This key derivation creates three sub-keys which are used to configure a straddling checkerboard, a columnar transposition, and a disrupted columnar transposition. The two changeable parts of the key were the date, which was simply the date on the message, and the key group which was random and inserted into the message itself.",

    "Description": "The Vigenère cipher is named for Blaise de Vigenère though it had been developed earlier by Giovan Battista Bellaso in 1553. It was once known as 'le chifre indéchiffrable' (the unsolvable cipher) as it was among the first ciphers to provide more security than a simple substitution cipher. The keyword is used as if it were a series of Caesar ciphers. Although Babbage and Kasiski independetly developed methods to break the cipher in the mid 1800s its popular reputation as unbreakable persisted into the early 1900s.\nSeveral variants exist:\n  Autokey - patterns of repetition in the key can be removed by using the text of the message itself once the original key runs out.\n  Mulitkey - By encrypting a message several times the security of a Vigenere cipher can be increased dramatically. The effective key length is no greater than the least common multiple of all the keys used. The pair of key words 'VIGENERE' and 'CIPHER' would have a key with a length of 24. Further it is hard to seperate out the overlapping keys meaning that even if attacker has a large amount of text and knows the period of the key they cannot easily guess it.\n If used with high quality pseudorandom data decryption is nearly impossible as any ciphertext can be produced by any plaintext and a version is still common in modern digital encryption.\n  Progressive Key - An additional shift is added each time the key repeats in order to stretch out the key.",

    "Description": "The XChaCha cipher is a variation on the ChaCha cipher that has a 192-bit nonce instead of the 64-bit or 96-bit nonce used in ordinary ChaCha. This is accomplished by using the ChaCha block function to create a synthetic key from the 256-bit key and the first 128-bits of the nonce. The key extracted from this process is then used along with the last 64-bits of the key to encrypt the message. The larger nonce size makes it feasible to choose nonces randomly without risk of collision.",

Each of those is XORed into the original secret, creating the last piece. The secret can then be recovered only by XORing all of the pieces together. Messages encrypted this way should be padded to avoid exposing information about their length. Unlike secret thresholding based sharing algorithms this splitting algorithm cannot be set up to use only a portion of the pieces, making it less felxible and significantly more fragile.",
