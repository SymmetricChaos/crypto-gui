{
  "Composite": "Composite ciphers are made by combining multiple ciphers of different kinds.",
  "Digital (Block)": "Digital block ciphers use a block function to encrypt bytes of data a chunk at a time. They may be operated in various modes.",
  "Digital (Stream)": "Digital stream ciphers produce a secure sequence of pseudorandom bytes which are XORed into the plaintext. All stream cipher are reciprocal.",
  "Electromechanical": "In the 20th century powerful electromechanical cipher machines like Enigma rose to dominance before being usurped by modern digital ciphers.",
  "Playfair": "These ciphers are all based on the Playfair cipher.",
  "Polyalphabetic": "Polyalphabetic ciphers encrypt characters using a sequence of substitution ciphers, ideally a different one each time.",
  "Polybius": "These ciphers are based on the the Polybius square which converts characters into a pair of numbers.",
  "Public Key": "",
  "Secret Sharing": "Several forms of encryption exist that split a secret into multiple pieces so that each individually gives no information about the secret.",
  "Substitution": "The simplest kind of cipher is to substitute each character with some other character or group of characters.",
  "Tactical": "Tactical ciphers exist to encrypt military information that will quickly become irrelevant. As a result they provide only a little security.",
  "Transposition": "These ciphers encrypt information by moving characters around, creating a complex anagram."
