  "Electromechanical": "In the 20th century powerful electromechanical cipher machines like Enigma rose to dominance before being usurped by modern digital ciphers.",
  "Polyalphabetic": "Polyalphabetic ciphers encrypt characters using a sequence of substitution ciphers, ideally a different one each time.",
  "Substitution": "The simplest kind of cipher is to substitute each character with some other character or group of characters.",
  "Transposition": "These ciphers encrypt information by moving characters around, creating a complex anagram.",
  "Playfair": "These ciphers are all based on the Playfair cipher.",
  "Tactical": "Tactical ciphers exist to encrypt military information that will quickly become irrelevant. As a result they provide only a little security.",
  "Polybius": "These ciphers are based on the the Polybius square which converts characters into a pair of numbers.",
  "Digital": "Digital ciphers are created to work on modern digital computers and operates on bytes of data rather than on characters of text.",
  "Secret Sharing": "Several forms of encryption exist that split a secret into multiple pieces so that each individually gives no information about the secret.",
  "Composite": "Composite ciphers are made by combining multiple ciphers of different kinds."
