      "morseitu": "The best known version of Morse Code is the ITU Standard. It uses two kind of signals the 'dit' and 'dah' with the dah defined as three times the length of the dit. Morse code also requires periods with no signal, called spaces, in order to differentiate characters. The subset of ITU Morse below covers all the printing characters. Additional control signals and prosigns are not yet supported. The space between dits and dahs is the same length as a dit, between characters is a space of three dits, between words is a space of seven dits.\n\nDits may be entered as a period `.` instead of the cdot `Â·` shown for display.",
      "morseamerican": "The now obsolete American Morse encoding, the original code developed by Morse and Vail, differs significantly from the better known Internation Morse code. Like ITU Morse it consists principly of short 'dit' and long 'dah' signals along with spaces however it includes two extra long signals used only for for L and for 0. American Morse also includes a lengthend intra-character space used for C, O, R, Y, and Z.",
      "morseprussian": "The Prussian Morse code system, eventually known as Continental Morse, was developed by Gerke and introduced the innovation of having only two signal types along with spaces. It was eventually be adapted into the standardized International Morse."
