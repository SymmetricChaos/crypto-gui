  "ASCII": "The American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII) was created in the 1960s and consists of 128 characters sufficient to write essentially all English text and to control the printing device. Originally a 7-bit code it is now most often seen as an 8-bit code with the leading bit always set to zero. The limitations of ASCII became more apparent as it emerged as a defacto standard for computer text even outside the United States. Today the UTF-8 of Unicode encoding fully subsumes ASCII.\nTher are 34 ASCII control codes that do not print a visible character. These incldue the null character (NUL) and the space character (SP). When encoding this page accepts both literal control characters and their control pictures. When decoding the control pictures are always used except for the SPACE control picture.",
  "Bacon": "Fancis Bacon developed this fixed width code (though he called it a cipher) in 1605, assigning each letter of the classical Latin alphabet a five bit code. The intended use was to hide one text in another by writing letters of the larger text in two different ways to represent the bits of the hidden message.",
  "Base32": "Base32 works similarly to the more popular Base64 encoding but operates on groups of five bits. This introduces more overhead than Base64 but the smaller character set makes it possible to remove characters that might be confused, important if the string must be copied by a person, or even to make forming words impossible, which may be a requirement if stored on a system that forbids profanity or other kinds of text.",
  "Base64": "Base64 is a popular form of binary-to-text encoding that converts arbitary data into a sequence of characters. The original goal of this was to ensure that systems that handled bytes of data in different ways but all recognized certain characters could handle the data without corrupting it. Today it is more common as a method to obscure the data. Each possible six bit group is encoded as an eight bit ASCII character for about 33% overhead. The input on this site only allowed UTF-8 encoded text strings.",
  "Baudot": "The Baudot Code is a five bit telegraphy code developed by Emile Baudot of France that extended its character set by being able to switch modes (essentially making a six bit code with the sixth bit stored on the transmitter and reciever rather than in the code). A variation known as ITA2 created by Donald Murray of New Zealand would become the major international standard for telegraphy in the 20th century. The US Teletypewriter Code was a variation of ITA2 used in the United States. While the various Baudot codes would be superceded for most purposes by standards such as ASCII and Unicode, ITA2 remains in rare usage today.",
  "Block": "In a block code (or fixed-width code) every code group contains the same number of symbols. The ASCII, UTF-32, and Bacon codes are examples of block codes. All block codes are examples of prefix codes.",
  "Elias": "The family of Elias codes are prefix codes.",
  "Fibonacci": "The Fibonacci code is a prefix code that assigns a binary sequence to each positive integer. So long as larger integers appear less frequently than smaller ones this encoding is within a constant factor of an optimal encoding. More importantly the Fibonacci code is self-synchronizing. Alterting a single bit will either incorrectly split a single code or incorrectly merge two codes but following codes will not be affected.",
  "Gödel": "Gödel's encoding was designed to allow statements of mathematical logic to be encoded as numbers so that mathematical logic could be applied to itself. The technique is simple: A positive integer is assigned to each word or symbol, then a finite sequence of integers is encoded as the sequence of primes raised to the power of each value and that is multiplied together. The original sequence is recovered by factoring. For example: the sequence of numbers (1, 2, 3) would be encoded as 2^1 × 3^2 × 5^3 = 2 × 9 × 125 = 2250.",
  "Morse": "The best known version of Morse Code is the ITU Standard. It uses two kind of signals the 'dit' and 'dah' with the dah defined as three times the length of the dit. Morse code also requires periods with no signal, called spaces, in order to differentiate characters. The subset of ITU Morse below covers all the printing characters. Additional control signals and prosigns are not yet supported. The space between dits and dahs is the same length as a dit, between characters is a space of three dits. The older American Morse standard is slightly different, still using dits and dahs of the same size but also including a double length space within come characters.",
  "Needle": "The needle code is the coding method using by the earliest electrical telegraph system created by Cooke and Wheatstone. Letters were arranged in a diamond shaped grid with five needles across the middle. Letters were indicated by turning two of the needles so that they pointed to a specific letter. Although it required no training to use the complexity and unreliability of this system was a problem. Later needle codes were created that used just one or two needles and did not operate by pointing.",
  "PGP Words": "The PGP Words converts a sequence of bytes into a sequence of words. To prevent errors this is done using two list which alternate back and forth. The even list uses words with two syllables and the odd list uses words with three syllables.",
  "Punycode": "Punycode is a method for re-encoding short Unicode strings using only ASCII characters, originally created for use with Internationalized Domain Names. The characters which are not ASCII are stripped out of the string, a delimeter character is placed after the remaining characters, then the non-ASCII characters are encoded onto the end using a method that records their position and Unicode codepoint. For example the sentence \"TạisaohọkhôngthểchỉnóitiếngViệt\" is encoded as \"TisaohkhngthchnitingVit-kjcr8268qyxafd2f1b9g\".",
  "Romaji": "It is often convient or necessary for Japanese text to be rendered in Latin characters. To accomplish this an encoding known as romaji (roman characters) is used. Several version are available: Kunrei-shiki is endorsed by the government of Japan, Hebern-shiki is widely used in the West, Nihon-shiki is a highly regular encoding no longer in common use.\nNotes on decoding: Decoding romaji back to kana is an imperfect process. The system used here does not vary with the variant chosen and should provide a decoding of any valid romaji. Because information is lost when encoding this decoding may not be perfectly accurate. For instance the を (wo) and お (o) kana are both transliterated as 'o' in Kunrei and Hebern. Likewise っに and んに are both rendered as `nni` in all encodings used. Decoding is consistent, so 'o' always becomes お while 'nni' always becomes んに but these many not reflect the original kana.",
  "S/KEY": "The S/KEY standard covers a system for human readable use of one time passwords. Here is recreated just the binary-to-text encoding used for the 64-bit passwords. Each password is converted into six words representing 11 bits each for a total of 66 bits, the bits of the password followed by a two bit error check.",
  "Spelling Alphabet": "Spelling Alphabets are designed to spell short sequences of letter over voice channels where noise might caught ambiguity. Written specifications for these systems appeared in the early 20th century with several focusing only on the most easily confused letters. The most widely used international standard today is the one specified by the ICAO, though it is commonly called the NATO Phonetic Alphabet.",
  "Tap": "Tap codes work on the same principle as the Polybius square cipher but simplified for ease of use. Characters are specified by pairs of tap sequences. The first sequence of taps selects a row and the second sequence of taps a column in that row. This very slow way of encoding text is said to be common among prisoners as it is easy to learn and requires no special tools.",
  "Unary": "The Unary Encoding is the simplest prefix code (meaning no code appears as the prefix of any other) and thus the simplest useful variable length code. Unary codes are extremely inefficient in practice.",
  "Unicode": "Unicode is the dominant international standard for encoding of text using in most of the world writing systems with over 100,000 code points defined. There are three major encodings used called UTF-8, UTF-16, and UTF-32."
