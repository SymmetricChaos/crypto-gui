  "ASCII": "The American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII) was created in the 1960s and consists of 128 characters sufficient to write essentially all English text and to control the printing device. Originally a 7-bit code it is now most often seen as an 8-bit code with the leading bit always set to zero. The limitations of ASCII became more apparent as it emerged as a defacto standard for computer text even outside the United States. Today the UTF-8 of Unicode encoding fully subsumes ASCII.",
  "Bacon": "Fancis Bacon developed this fixed width code (though he called it a cipher) in 1605, assigning each letter of the classical Latin alphabet a five bit code. The intended use was to hide one text in another by writing letters of the larger text in two different ways to represent the bits of the hidden message.",
  "Base64": "Base64 is a binary code that is meant to re-encode arbitrary binary data as ASCII symbols that can then be transmitted safely through text channels and decoded on the other side.",
  "Baudot": "The Baudot Code is a five bit telegraphy code developed by Emile Baudot of France that extended its character set by being able to switch modes (essentially making a six bit code with the sixth bit stored on the recieving machine). A variation known as ITA2 created by Donald Murray of New Zealand would become the major international standard for telegraphy in the 20th century.",
  "Block": "In a block code (or fixed width code) every code group contains the same number of symbols. The ASCII, UTF-32, and Bacon codes are examples of block codes.",
  "Fibonacci": "The Fibonacci code is named because it uses the Fibonacci sequence to generate a variable width encoding of some arbitrary alphabet. More common characters are assigned shorter codes. This allows very large alphabets to be encoded efficiently so long as characters vary in frequency following a geometric distribution.",
  "Morse": "The best known version of Morse Code is the ITU Standard. It uses two kind of signals the 'dit' and 'dah' with the dah defined as three times the length of the dit. Morse code also requires periods with no signal, called spaces, in order to differentiate characters. The subset of ITU Morse below covers all the printing characters. Additional control signals and prosigns are not yet supported. The space between dits and dahs is the same length as a dit, between characters is a space of three dits. The older American Morse standard is slightly different, still using dits and dahs of the same size but also including a double length space within come characters.",
  "Needle": "The needle code is the coding method using by the earliest electrical telegraph system created by Cooke and Wheatstone. Letters were arranged in a diamond shaped grid with five needles across the middle. Letters were indicated by turning two of the needles so that they pointed to a specific letter. Although it required no training to use the complexity and unreliability of this system was a problem. Later needle codes were created that used just one or two needles and did not operate by pointing.",
  "PGP Words": "The PGP Words converts a sequence of bytes into a sequence of words. To prevent errors this is done using two list which alternate back and forth. The even list uses words with two syllables and the odd list uses words with three syllables.",
  "Punycode": "Punycode is a method for re-encoding short Unicode strings using only ASCII characters, originally created for use with Internationalized Domain Names. The characters which are not ASCII are stripped out of the string, a delimeter character is placed after the remaining characters, then the non-ASCII characters are encoded onto the end using a method that records their position and Unicode codepoint. For example the sentence \"TạisaohọkhôngthểchỉnóitiếngViệt\" is encoded as \"TisaohkhngthchnitingVit-kjcr8268qyxafd2f1b9g\".",
  "Spelling Alphabet": "Spelling Alphabets are designed to spell short sequences of letter over voice channels where noise might caught ambiguity. Written specifications for these systems appeared in the early 20th century with several focusing only on the most easily confused letters. The most widely used international standard today is the one specified by the ICAO, though it is commonly called the NATO Phonetic Alphabet.",
  "Tap": "Tap codes work on the same principle as the Polybius square cipher but simplified for ease of use. Characters are specified by pairs of tap sequences. The first sequence of taps selects a row and the second sequence of taps a column in that row. This very slow way of encoding text is said to be common among prisoners as it is easy to learn and requires no special tools.",
  "Unary": "The Unary Encoding is the simplest prefix code and thus the simplest useful variable length code. No code word appears as a prefix of any other code word.",
  "Unicode": "Unicode is the dominant international standard for encoding of text using in most of the world writing systems with over 100,000 code points defined. There are three major encodings used called UTF-8, UTF-16, and UTF-32."
