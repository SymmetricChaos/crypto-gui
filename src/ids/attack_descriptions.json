  "Caesar": "For a Caesar cipher there are only as many possible keys as characters in the alphabet (26 in this case) so it is easiest to just check every possible key.",
  "Substitution": "General substitution ciphers have a very large keyspace but are vulnerable to straighforward attack by computer. The hill climbing method attempts to build the correct key by repeatedly making small changes to a guess and accepting only changes that produce a more plausible text. Here the change is simply swapping the position of two ramdom characters in the alphabet."
