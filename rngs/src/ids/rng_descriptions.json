  "Halton Sequence": "The Halton sequence produces tuples of rational numbers between 0 and 1 distributed across any number of dimensions.",
  "Linear Congruential Generator": "LCGs are among the simplest forms of pseduorandom number generators using the well known arithmetic operations of multiplication, addition, and division. At each step the current state is multiplied by a constant, then has a constant added, and finally is divided by a constant and the remainder taken. The result is saved at the new state and also returned as the next pseudorandom value. Here all the values are limited to 32 bits.",
  "Linear Feedback Shift Register": "LFRSs are simple pseudorandom number generators that work by examining a few bits of their state to calculate the next bit.",
  "Middle Square": "The middle square method produces random numbers of a given width, padded on the left with zeroes, by squaring a value and then taking the middle digits as the next value. The quality of these sequences is very low and often falls quickly into short repeating sequences.",
  "Weyl Sequence": "A Weyl sequence, as defined by Marsaglia, distributes values among integers from zero to some maximum using just addition and division. An increment value is chosen which is co-prime to the size of the interval. The increment is then added to the state and the remainder of division by the size of the interval is made the next state."
