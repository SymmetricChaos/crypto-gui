  "Halton Sequence": "The Halton sequence is a quasirandom number generator that produces tuples of rational numbers distributed across any number of dimensions.",
  "Linear Congruential Generator": "LCGs are among the simplest forms of pseduorandom number generators using the well known arithmetic operations of multiplication, addition, and division. At each step the current state is multiplied by a constant, then has a constant added, and finally is divided by a constant and the remainder taken. The result is saved at the new state and also returned as the next pseudorandom value. Here all the values are limited to 32 bits.",
  "Linear Feedback Shift Register": "LFRSs are simple pseudorandom number generators that work by examining a few bits of their state to calculate the next bit."
