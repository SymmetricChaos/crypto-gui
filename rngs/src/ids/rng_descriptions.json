  "Halton Sequence": "The Halton sequence produces tuples of rational numbers between 0 and 1 distributed across any number of dimensions.",
  "Linear Congruential Generator": "LCGs are among the simplest forms of pseduorandom number generators using the well known arithmetic operations of multiplication, addition, and division. At each step the current state is multiplied by a constant, then has a constant added, and finally is divided by a constant and the remainder taken.",
  "Linear Feedback Shift Register": "LFRSs are simple pseudorandom number generators that work by examining a few bits of their state to calculate the next bit.",
  "Middle Square": "The middle square method produces random numbers of a given width, padded on the left with zeroes, by squaring a value and then taking the middle digits as the next value. The quality of these sequences is very low and often falls quickly into short repeating sequences.",
  "Permuted Congruential Generator": "A PCG is a linear congruential generator combined with some non-linear transformation of the state after each step.",
  "Weyl Sequence": "The original Weyl squence produces real numbers distributed between 0 and 1 by repeatedly adding an irrational number to the current state and taking the fractional part. For computer purposes Marsaglia defined Weyl sequences as incrementing the state by some value and then taking the remainder when divided by some value coprime to the increment."
