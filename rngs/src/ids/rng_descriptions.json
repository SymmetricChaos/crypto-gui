  "Halton Sequence": "The Halton sequence produces tuples of rational numbers between 0 and 1 distributed across any number of dimensions.",
  "Lagged Fibonacci Generator": "An LFG uses a generalized Fibonacci sequence to generate pseudorandom numbers.",
  "Linear Congruential Generator": "LCGs are among the simplest forms of pseduorandom number generators using the well known arithmetic operations of multiplication, addition, and division. At each step the current state is multiplied by a constant, then has a constant added, and finally is divided by a constant and the remainder taken. The increment must be coprime to the modulus and the multiplier must be greater than one.",
  "Linear Feedback Shift Register": "LFRSs are simple pseudorandom number generators that work by examining a few bits of their state to calculate the next bit.",
  "Middle Square": "The middle square method produces random numbers of a given width, padded on the left with zeroes, by squaring a value and then taking the middle digits as the next value. The quality of these sequences is very low and often falls quickly into short repeating sequences.",
  "Permuted Congruential Generator": "A PCG is a linear congruential generator combined with some non-linear transformation of the state before it is output. In principle many LCGs and transformations are possible but the ones here are suggested by the original PCG paper. For the same reason the state is always 64 bits and the output is always 32 bits, consequently the increment of the underyling LCG must always be odd.",
  "Weyl Sequence": "The original Weyl squence produces real numbers distributed between 0 and 1 by repeatedly adding an irrational number to the current state and taking the fractional part. For computer purposes Marsaglia defined Weyl sequences as incrementing the state by some value and then taking the remainder when divided by some value coprime to the increment."
