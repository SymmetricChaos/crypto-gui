# What is Crypto-GUI?
It is an implementation of various classical ciphers and codes that I'm making for fun.


# Contributing
I am, of course, happy to take suggestions for new ciphers or codes though please include some specification for the code. However, the contributions I'm most interested in are for accurate historical data. The actual wiring of SIGABA is not something I've been able to find. The vocabulary cards used for BATCO also seem to exist but I don't know how to find them.
