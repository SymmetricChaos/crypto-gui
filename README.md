# ⚠ WARNING NOT FOR USE ⚠
The implementations here are made to match test vectors or pass known answer tests (or a representative subset of them). They are not constant time nor do they make any other attempt to be secure beyond the outputs. Proper cryptography also needs to part of a properly implemented cryptographic scheme for generating and managing keys. Old ciphers offer no real security regardless of implementation and some RNGs and hashers will run slowly due to limited optimization.

# What is Crypto-GUI?
It is an implementation of various ciphers, codes, hasher, and random number generators that I'm making for fun. The goals are correctness of outputs and legibility of the code.

# Why on Earth do that?
I enjoy making little things that work in order to understand them. Many of these algorithms are hard to find except as intensely optimized code or vague pseudocode so these implementations may be of interest to some.

# Contributing
I am, of course, happy to take suggestions for new ciphers or codes though please include some specification for the code. However, the contributions I'm most interested in are for accurate historical data. The actual wiring of SIGABA is not something I've been able to find. The vocabulary cards used for BATCO also seem to exist but I don't know how to find them.
