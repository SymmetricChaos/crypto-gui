  "MD4": "The MD4 hash function, created by Ronald Rivest in 1990, is an obsolete hash algorithm that influenced the design of later hash functions.",
  "MD5": "The MD5 hash function, created by Ronald Rivest in 1991, is among the best known and most widely used in history. Weaknesses were discovered in the algorithm within a few years that resulted in its deprecation for secure purposes. It wasn't until 2004, however, that collisions were discovered. Today MD5 is used to verify message integrity against accidental changes.",
  "Pearson": "Pearson hashing is one of the simplest hashing algorithms.",
  "SipHash": "SipHash is a family of keyed hash functions."
